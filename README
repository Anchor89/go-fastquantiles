Approximate streaming quantiles


My goal is to implement:

"A Fast Algorithm for Approximate Quantiles in High Speed Data Streams" (Qi Zhang and Wei Wang, 2007).

Zhang/Wang is based on Greenwald and Khanna's algorithm from
http://infolab.stanford.edu/~datar/courses/cs361a/papers/quantiles.pdf

So I decided to start with GK.  There's a good overview at
http://papercruncher.com/2010/03/02/stream-algorithms-order-statistics/

and more detailed notes at

The MERGE algorithm is taken from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~xujian/paper/quant.pdf
